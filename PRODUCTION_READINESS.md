## üìã Recommended Improvements (Before Launch)

### 1. ‚úÖ Production Error Monitoring - COMPLETED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Sentry installed and configured  
**Setup Time:** 5-10 minutes to get DSN from sentry.io

**What's Configured:**
- ‚úÖ Client-side error tracking
- ‚úÖ Server-side error tracking
- ‚úÖ Edge runtime (middleware) tracking
- ‚úÖ Centralized error logger utility
- ‚úÖ User context tracking
- ‚úÖ Session replay on errors
- ‚úÖ Automatic source map support

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Sign up at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (free tier: 100k events/month)
2. Create a Next.js project
3. Copy your DSN
4. Add to `.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here`
5. Add to Azure environment variables

**Documentation:**
- Setup guide: `SENTRY_SETUP.md`
- Quick reference: `SENTRY_QUICKREF.md`
- Error logger: `src/lib/error-logger.ts`

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time error alerts
- ‚úÖ Stack traces with context
- ‚úÖ User impact tracking
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Session replay for debugging

### 2. Code Quality (Priority: Medium - Optional)
**Issue:** ~150 remaining `console.log` statements throughout codebase  
**Impact:** Logs may expose sensitive data and clutter production logs  
**Status:** Critical paths now use error logger; remaining console.logs are low priority

**Recommendation:**
- Gradually migrate remaining `console.error` to `logError()` from error-logger
- Most console.logs are non-critical and can remain
**Found ~30 TODO comments in code:**

**Authentication (High Priority):**
- `src/lib/auth.ts:177` - Password verification currently skipped for demo
  - **Action:** Implement proper bcrypt password verification before production

**File Upload (Medium Priority):**
- `src/app/api/profile/update/route.ts:60,79` - Avatar upload to Azure Blob Storage
  - **Action:** Implement Azure Blob Storage integration or use placeholder avatars

**Pagination (Low Priority):**
- `src/components/library/dynamic-library.tsx:344` - Load more functionality
  - **Action:** Implement pagination or infinite scroll

**Notifications Triggers (Medium Priority):**
- Notification creation triggers not wired up yet
  - **Action:** Add `createNotification()` calls for:
    - New comments (`src/app/api/works/[id]/comments/route.ts`)
    - New likes/ratings
    - New follows
    - Work published
    - @mentions in discussions

### 4. Security Hardening (Priority: High)

**Current Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting active
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection via Next.js
- ‚úÖ Secure headers middleware
- ‚úÖ Input validation with Zod
- ‚úÖ SQL injection protection (Prisma ORM)
- ‚úÖ XSS protection
- ‚úÖ Admin route protection

**Recommendations:**
1. **Remove debug endpoint:**
   ```bash
   # Disable or delete src/app/api/debug/auth/route.ts
   ```

2. **Implement password hashing:**
   - Currently using demo password verification
   - Enable bcrypt in `src/lib/auth.ts`

3. **Review admin access logs:**
   - Admin access currently logs to console
   - Consider database audit logging

4. **Enable TOTP for all admins:**
   - Enforce 2FA for admin accounts

### 5. Environment Variables (Priority: Critical)

**Verify these are set in Azure App Service:**

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=<strong-secret-key>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<strong-secret-key>
NODE_ENV=production
DOMAIN=sharedthread.co
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://sharedthread.co

# Email
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
FROM_EMAIL=hello@sharedthread.co
FROM_NAME=Shared Thread

# Optional but recommended
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<if-using-ai-features>
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000
```

**Security Notes:**
- ‚úÖ JWT_SECRET is cryptographically strong (64 chars)
- ‚úÖ Database credentials use strong password
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure secrets are not committed to Git

### 6. Performance Optimization (Priority: Medium)

**Current Performance:**
- Build size: ~216 kB First Load JS (includes Sentry ~114 kB)
- Static pages properly pre-rendered
- API routes use proper caching headers

**Recommendations:**
1. **Enable Redis for session storage** (optional)
   - Currently using database sessions
   - Redis would reduce database load

2. **Image optimization:**
   - Use Next.js Image component for avatars
   - Configure Azure CDN for static assets

3. **Database indexing:**
   - Review Prisma schema indexes
   - Monitor slow queries in production

### 7. Monitoring & Observability (Priority: High)

**Set up monitoring for:**
- [x] **Application errors (Sentry)** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [ ] Database performance (Azure metrics)
- [ ] API response times (Sentry performance monitoring)
- [ ] User authentication success/failure rates
- [ ] Rate limit hits
- [ ] Background job status (if applicable)

**Recommended metrics:**
- User signups per day
- Active users
- Work creation rate
- Community engagement
- Search queries
- Error rates by endpoint

## üéâ You're Ready!

Your application is **production-ready** with the caveats noted above. The most critical items to address before public launch are:

1. **Enable password hashing** (5 minutes)
2. **Remove debug endpoints** (2 minutes)
3. **Set up error monitoring** (30 minutes)
4. **Run production smoke tests** (30 minutes)

Everything else can be done post-launch as improvements!

**Recommended Timeline:**
- Today: Fix critical security items (password hashing, debug endpoint)
- Tomorrow: Deploy to production, run smoke tests
- Day 3: Set up monitoring and alerts
- Week 1: Monitor closely, fix any issues
- Week 2+: Implement improvements based on real usage
